Exercise3:

In this case,in the Gaussian case, mean = 5 and sigma = 20 and for the salt-and-pepper case, pa =0.03 and pb = 0.03. We can also change the values to get different results.

When we change the kernel sizes, the images will become fuzzy.

For Gaussiannoise, the Gaussian filter works better. And Median filter works better for salt and pepper noise.
